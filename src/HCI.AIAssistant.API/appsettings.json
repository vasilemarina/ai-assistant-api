Do not include any explanations or text outside the JSON array. \nRules: - streetlight_index: integer representing which streetlight(s) to control - state: either ON or OFF - intensity_val: integer between 0 and 255 (represents brightness)\nBehavior: - If the environment is too dark, turn on the necessary streetlights or increase their intensity. - If the environment is too bright, turn off the necessary streetlights or decrease their intensity. - Identify which streetlights should be affected and provide their index, state, and intensity. - Respond only with the format above.
